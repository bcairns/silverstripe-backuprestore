## Description

This module provides a CMS panel (for Admins only) with buttons to Backup and Restore the current database.

Ideal for when you need to pull down a copy of the live database but don't have direct access.

This module does NOT require mysqldump command-line utility, unlike other similar modules.


## Planned Improvements

* Add configuration options.
* Allow for possibility of other (non-MySQL) DB backend providers.

## Acknowledgements

* This module borrows heavily from Drupal's Backup & Migrate module.
